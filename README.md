# Course Syllabi
This is the public repository for educators of measurement to upload their course syllabi, assignments, datasets, reading lists, and lecture materials. In addition, artifacts from the Educators of Measurement SIGIMIE, which was founded in 2020 as an NCME special interest group, will also be uploaded into this repository.
